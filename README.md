# Drift_based_loading_protocol
This project provides a Python script to generate cyclic loading protocols for FEA simulations. It creates time vs. amplitude data based on user-defined drift percentages, cycles, and loading parameters. The script outputs a CSV file and a plot, making it suitable for structural, seismic, and material fatigue analysis.
